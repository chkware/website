# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature standardizes the vertical spacing between all homepage sections to create consistent visual rhythm and improved user experience. The implementation will ensure all sections have uniform padding of 10rem (160px) top and bottom on desktop devices, while maintaining responsive behavior for mobile devices.

3. WHEN viewing sections on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive padding that scales appropriately
4. WHEN sections have existing custom spacing THEN the system SHALL override with standardized spacing

3. WHEN sections require different spacing THEN the system SHALL provide modifier classes for exceptions
4. WHEN updating spacing values THEN changes SHALL be applied globally through CSS variables

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrolling between sections THEN there SHALL be consistent white space that creates visual separation
2. WHEN sections have background colors THEN the spacing SHALL create clear boundaries between content areas
3. WHEN viewing the page THEN no sections SHALL appear cramped or have excessive spacing
4. WHEN content varies in length THEN the spacing SHALL remain consistent regardless of content volume

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want appropriate spacing that works on smaller screens, so that content remains readable and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on tablet (768px-1023px) THEN sections SHALL have 6rem (96px) padding top and bottom
2. WHEN viewing on mobile (≤767px) THEN sections SHALL have 4rem (64px) padding top and bottom
3. WHEN switching between device sizes THEN spacing SHALL transition smoothly
4. WHEN content overflows on mobile THEN spacing SHALL not cause horizontal scrolling
